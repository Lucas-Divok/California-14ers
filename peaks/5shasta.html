            <h3>Route Description:</h3>
            <p>From Bunny Flat trailhead (6,950'), follow the wide, well-marked trail as it climbs gently through a beautiful red fir and Shasta red fir forest. The trail is often snow-covered even in summer. After about 1.8 miles and 1,000 feet of elevation gain, reach Horse Camp at 7,900', a stone cabin built by the Sierra Club that serves as an emergency shelter. Water is available from a spring near the cabin during summer months.</p>

            <p>From Horse Camp, the route becomes less defined as you enter the alpine zone. Continue ascending northwest across increasingly open terrain, following cairns and bootpack trails when snow is present. The forest thins out completely as you climb toward timberline around 8,500'.</p>

            <p>Continue ascending the broad, open slopes of Avalanche Gulch. Around 10,000', reach Helen Lake, a popular high camp location nestled in a scenic basin beneath the towering summit pyramid. This is the most common overnight camping spot, offering some wind protection and stunning views. Most climbers establish camp here before attempting the summit.</p>

            <p>From Helen Lake, the route steepens significantly. Begin climbing the 50-degree snow slopes of Avalanche Gulch proper. Crampons, ice axe and helmet are essential from this point forward. Ascend approximately 2,000 feet up the gulch, following the most consolidated snow and established bootpack. Watch for rockfall, especially later in the day as the sun warms the slopes.</p>

            <p>Around 12,400', reach the Red Banks, a prominent band of reddish volcanic rock that marks the upper section of the climb. Navigate through or around the Red Banks via a steep chute or by traversing left. This section often has the steepest and most exposed terrain of the route.</p>

            <p>Above the Red Banks, continue ascending the broad summit plateau. The angle eases somewhat, but altitude becomes the primary challenge. Around 13,500', pass Misery Hill, a false summit that has crushed many climbers' spirits.</p>

            <p>From Misery Hill, traverse northwest across the summit plateau for the final push. At 14,179', reach the true summit of Mount Shasta, marked by a summit register and breathtaking 360-degree views of Northern California and beyond. On clear days, see Mount Lassen to the south and into Oregon to the north.</p>

            <p>Descend via the same route, taking care on the steep snow slopes. Glissading is possible and popular on the descent through Avalanche Gulch when conditions permit, significantly speeding the return to Helen Lake and eventually back to Bunny Flat.</p>
