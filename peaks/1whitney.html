            <h3>Route Description:</h3>
            <p>From Whitney Portal (8,360'), follow the well-maintained Mount Whitney Trail as it begins climbing through pine forest. After about 2 miles, reach Lone Pine Creek and cross a footbridge. The trail continues ascending through switchbacks, passing North Fork Lone Pine Creek around 2.8 miles.
At approximately 6 miles and 10,400', reach Outpost Camp, a popular camping area with water access. Continue climbing through more switchbacks as the forest begins to thin. Around 8 miles, reach Mirror Lake at 10,640', nestled in a scenic basin.
Pass Trailside Meadow at 8.7 miles (10,800'), where water is usually available. The trail continues ascending, and near 9.5 miles you'll reach Trail Camp at 12,000' elevation, the highest camping area with established sites. This is a common spot for overnight trips.
From Trail Camp, the trail steepens considerably. Begin the famous 99 switchbacks, a relentless series of tight turns carved into the mountainside. Gain approximately 1,600 feet over the next 2 miles as you ascend the steep granite face. Around 11.5 miles, reach Trail Crest at 13,600', where you'll cross to the west side of the Sierra Crest. Enjoy dramatic views into Sequoia National Park.
From Trail Crest, turn north and follow the ridgeline trail. The path undulates along the west side of the crest, passing several windows and notches with spectacular drop-offs. Continue for approximately 2 miles along this exposed section. Near 13.6 miles, reach the junction with the John Muir Trail.
Continue north on the final push to the summit. The trail climbs gradually over large granite blocks and slabs. At 14,505', reach the summit of Mount Whitney, the highest point in the contiguous United States. The summit plateau features a stone hut and incredible 360-degree views.
