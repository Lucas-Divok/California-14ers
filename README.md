# California 14ers

## About

The point of this project is to create a website similar to 14ers.com (which focuses on Colorado's fourteeners), but specifically for California's 14,000+ foot peaks. 
Currently, there is no dedicated website for California 14ers, which makes it difficult to find summary reports and up-to-date trail conditions. As someone who hikes these peaks regularly, I wanted to create a modern, centralized resource for the California hiking community.

## About Me

I'm a Computer Science student at WGU with a passion for hiking, backpacking, and mountaineering. I've summited Cotopaxi in Ecuador, attempted Chimborazo and Pico de Orizaba, and completed the Gokyo Ri trek in Nepal. I regularly climb California's 14ers in both summer and winter conditions. This project combines my interest in web development with my love for the outdoors.
